## Todo App

This project contains a simple TODO application
It has the following features - 

- Anyone can create a todo
- Anyone can see their existing todos
- Anyone can mark a todo as done 

Building the app step by step:

Step 1 : Setting up the app and Backend
- put a package.json by "npm init" in backend directory
- setup express in index.js 
    - setup zod in types.js
    - setup schema and export and import them
- Write backend logic for all the requests


Step 2 : Frontend

- npm create vite@latest
- project name frontend
- render the data
- make fetch as ASYNC (find out why?)
- Better Error handling using the messgaes from the backend













When you send your code to someone you don't send the "node_modules" folder as when they run the "npm install" cmd node installs all the module used in the project by reading the "dependencies" key in package.json
